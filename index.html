        <p>Hi! My name is Kaitlin Heusner. I was born in Quito, Ecuador but I grew up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. I come from a family of 5 with an older and younger brother. My favorite hobbies are reading, playing video games, and listening to music. </p>
        <p>I am currently a Software Engineering Major, and I am taking this course because I wanted to learn HTML and CSS so I could understand how to use them to make websites.</p>
